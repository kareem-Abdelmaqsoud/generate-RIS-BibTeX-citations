Introducing a powerful software package that makes it easy to generate RIS and BibTeX citations for your academic papers and references. With this package, you can say goodbye to the tedious and time-consuming task of manually creating citations for your research work. All you need to do is to pip install this package, input the doi of the paper and select the format you want your citation to be in, and this package will automatically generate the citation for you. 

Note: This package retrieves the information about the requested paper from the OpenAlex database, which is not always as updated as google scholar when it comes to citation counts.
